			<h1>Sound of the Sea</h1>
			<p>Being near and hearing the ocean brings calm. The repetitive sounds of the water crashing is soothing and calming. "These slow, whooshing noises are the sounds of non-threats, which is why they work to calm people," says associate professor of biobehavioral health Orfeu Buxton. "It's like they're saying: "Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry." These slow repetitive sounds slow breathing and reduce stress, bringing you closer to a meditative state known as Blue Mind.

			<h1>The Blue Mind</h1>
			<p>Blue Mind refers to the meditative sense attained when near or under water. There are physiological, mental, and emotional changes in the body when touching or even hearing the sound of water. Floating in water allows your muscles and brain to relax, which increases productivity and decreases cortisol levels.</p>
			<p>Even without access to water, you can still experience its benefits. Digital recordings of the ocean, like the one you're listening to now, have shown to improve sleep in those who experience restlessness. The noises of the ocean are calm, repetitive, and non threatening, which can mask disruptive noises and reduce stress in ways similar to water<br/> <a href="https://www.livescience.com/53403-why-sound-of-water-helps-you-sleep.html">Why Does the Sound of Water Help You Sleep?</a><br/><a href="https://www.fix.com/blog/benefits-of-being-near-water/">Blue Mind: The Health Benefits of Being by the Water</a></p>

			<h1>Find Your Water</h1>
			<p>To find your Blue Mind, seek out a source of water near you. A river, ocean, or lake is a great place to relax and take a break from Red mind. But if there are no natural sources of water near you, you can find a public pool, your bathtub or shower, or a public fountain to relax near by. Finding these sources of water is essential to enter Blue Mind </p>

		    <p>“Water does not resist. Water flows. When you plunge your hand into it, all you feel is a caress. Water is not a solid wall, it will not stop you. But water always goes where it wants to go, and nothing in the end can stand against it. Water is patient. Dripping water wears away a stone. Remember that, my child. Remember you are half water. If you can't go through an obstacle, go around it. Water does.” ― Margaret Atwood, The Penelopiad </p>
